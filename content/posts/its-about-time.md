summary: "An interesting question that gets passed around is how to measure the success of automation. One popular answer is by the number of bugs that are found in automation. But finding bugs isn't why we invest in automation. Sure, by running automation scripts bugs will occasionally be found, but that isn't why we do it. We do it to save time."
