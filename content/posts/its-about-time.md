summary: "An interesting question that gets passed around is how to measure the success of automation. One popular answer is by the number of bugs that are found in automation. In my opinion, that isn't why we should invest in automation. Sure, by running automation scripts we will occasionaly find bugs, but that isn't why we should do it. We should invest in automation to save time."
